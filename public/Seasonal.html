              <p id="about">The goal of the Penn State Exploration Guide is to help anyone visiting or living in the State College area to find things that they like to do in the area.
              We know that their are a large variety of tastes and preferences, so we have broken up our ideas into different groups.
              This way no matter who you are or what you are interested in, our site should be able to help you find something you like in the State College area.
              Our categories are Adventure, Elderly, Adult, Family, Student, and Seasonal but feel free to look through any category as many activities are enjoyable for people of all kinds!

            <p><b>Farmers Market</b></p>
            <p>It seems there’s a farmers market for every corner of the county, and that’s because this area is so rich in farms and folks who care about locally sourced food and products. The freshest produce, eggs, meat, cheese and so much more can be found each week at farmers markets around town. </p>
