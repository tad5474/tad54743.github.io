        <img src="images/Theatre.jpg" width="100%">
        <p>A great idea for entertainment while in State College is to take in a performance at The State Theatre.
          It is located right on College Ave and hosts a great variety of events throughout the year.
          You can check their website for upcoming events <a href="https://www.thestatetheatre.org/" target="_blank">here.</a>
          Another thing to do while downtown is to get yourself some new Penn State gear.
          There are plenty of shops all within walking distance where you can buy any kind of Penn State apperal and accessories you could need ranging from T-shirts, to mugs, to a carboard cut out of Joe Paterno.
          <a href="https://pennstateroom.com/" target="_blank">McLanahans</a>, <a href="https://www.thestudentbookstore.com/" target="_blank">The Student Bookstore</a>, and <a href="https://www.pennstateclothes.com/" target="_blank">The Family Clothesline</a> are just a few of these options.

        <img src="images/Stadium.jpg" width="100%">
        <p>If Penn State is away or you aren't going to the game yourself there are still a bunch of great places to watch the game in State College.
          One suggestion is to go to some of the restaurants downtown where you will be able to enjoy a nice meal while taking in the action.
          There are plenty of great bars and restaurants to choose from, but Cafe, Champs, Pickles, and Jax are a few good places to start.
          If you aren't so interested in getting food or the resturant feel, then maybe watching in the hub lobby would be a good option for you.
          Here you will be able to watch the game on a huge screen and will be sure to have plenty of other Penn State fans cheering along with you.</p>

        <img src="images/Palmer.jpg" width="100%">
        <p>While on the Penn State campus, the Palmer Mueseum of Art is a great place to check out.
          The museum is free to enter and not only has a vast number of objects that represent many different cultures, but also has ever changing events that come to the museum to always keep a visit fresh.
          Palmer is the largest art museum between Philadelphia and Pittsburg and is a must see while on campus.
          It is located near the top of campus beside the forum building and can easily be recognized by the two giant metal paws outside of it.
        You can check out their website <a href="https://palmermuseum.psu.edu/" target="_blank">here.</a> for upcoming events coming to the museum.</p>

        <img src="images/Military.jpg" width="100%">
        <p>If you are looking for something outside of State College, the Pennsylvania Military Museum is a great option.
          It is located in Boalsburg and is about a 10-15 minute car ride from campus.
          This museum is dedicated to the hisory of the military in Pennsylvania and has a focus mostly on WWI and WWII, but also has artifacts and informaion about many others.
          If you are interested in getting a guided tour, the adminsion is $8/person and needs to be scheduled 2 weeks in advance.
          However if you want to walk around yourself, then there is no requirment to make arrangments befor hand and the fee is $5.50 for seniors (65+), or $6 for adults.
          You can learn more about the museum and upcoming events at their website <a href="https://www.pamilmuseum.org/" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
