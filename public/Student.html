              <p id="about">The goal of the Penn State Exploration Guide is to help anyone visiting or living in the State College area to find things that they like to do in the area.
              We know that their are a large variety of tastes and preferences, so we have broken up our ideas into different groups.
              This way no matter who you are or what you are interested in, our site should be able to help you find something you like in the State College area.
              Our categories are Adventure, Elderly, Adult, Family, Student, and Seasonal but feel free to look through any category as many activities are enjoyable for people of all kinds!

The freshest produce, eggs, meat, cheese and so much more can be found each week at farmers markets around town. </p>

      <p><b> Nature Inn</b></p>
        <p>This nature-based inn is unlike anything in the PA parks system. Everything in and around the beautiful building was designed and built with the environment in mind. Guests can enjoy all that Bald Eagle State Park has to offer – or just sit and watch the birds from a private balcony. Visit their website to find out everything you need to know about Nature Inn.

        <p> <b>Tailgate </b></p>
          <p> Go find the greek life tailgates or a family tailgate. Personally I suggest finding a family tailgate because they have free food and drinks. Be careful though always use a red solo cup because the undercover cops will bust you. Click <a href="https://happyvalley.com/play/football-tailgating/" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.</p>
        <p> <b>Creamery </b></p>
          <p>The line might be long but its a perfet way to cool off. Everyone knows the Creamery has the very best ice cream in Pennsylvania and beyond. Whether you’re in State College for the day or putting down roots for a lifetime, a one-size-fits-all cone or cup of your favorite Creamery flavor is a bucket list imperative. Visit their website to check out the flavors and everything they have! Click <a href="https://creamery.psu.edu" target="_blank">here</a> to go to their website!</p>
        <p> <b>Fraternity Pregames </b></p>
          <p> Most fraternities will be hosting a pregame with food and drinks if you get up early enough. Just walk up and pretend you know someone! Enjoy the free drinks before heading over to Beaver Stadium. </p>
